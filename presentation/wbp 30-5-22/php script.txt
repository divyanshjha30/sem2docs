Query Strings and Hidden Fields

slide 3
so what are Hidden Fields?
We can store small amounts of information on the client by using hidden fields.
Hidden fields are HTML elements, similar to text boxes, where you can store strings.
Web browsers don't display hidden fields in page output.
However, when you use a hidden field within an HTML form, the contents are submitted back to your program.

slide 4
How to use Hidden Fields?
To use hidden fields, we need to use a code line that looks similar to the following within a <form> area tag
and to extract the hidden field's value, we use the Params collection in the Request object, using a code line like this.

slide 5
about Query Strings
we can also use query strings to pass parameters from page to page.
Query strings are bits of information appended to an URL as in the following line:
