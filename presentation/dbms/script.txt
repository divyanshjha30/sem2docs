slide 1
Goodmorning everyone im divyansh and i welcome you to my presentation on the topic

slide 2
set operators in SQL
where we'll talk about
what SQL operators are
types of SQL operators
their parameteres
syntax
and also their working

slide 3
So what are SQL operators?
SQL operators are special words or characters used to perform different tasks

slide 4
the different types of sql operators are:
Arithmetic Operators
Bitwise Operators
Comparison Operators
Compound Operators
Logical Operators
and also Set Operators

slide 5
Arithmetic operators comprise of the
add
subtract
multiply
divide
and modulo operators

slide 6
bitwise operators comprise of 
bitwise AND
Bitwise OR
and Bitwise exclusive OR operators

slide 7
comparison operators comprise of
equals to
greater than
less than
greater than equal to
less than equal to
and not equal to operators

slide 8
compound operators comprise of
add equals
subtract equals
multiply equals
divide equals
modulo equals
bitwise AND equals
divide equals
bitwise exclusive equals
and bitwise OR equals operators

slide 9
logical operators have
all
and
any
between
exists
in
like
not
or
and some operators

slide 10
Now lets see what set operators are
SQL set operators are used to combine the results obtained from two or more queries into a single result.

slide 11
There are four major types of SQL operators, namely:
union
union all
intersect
and minus

slide 12
The different parameters used in the syntax are :

SET OPERATOR: where we mention the set operator which we want to use
column_name: where we Mention the column name on which we want to perform the set operation
And the table names from where we want to fetch the data.

From the above-mentioned parameters, all the parameters are mandatory. You may use WHERE GROUP BY and HAVING clauses based on your requirements.

slide 13
Here you can see the syntax for the union set operator

slide 14
syntax for the union all set operator

slide 15
for the intersect set operator

slide 16
and for the minus set operator
the only thing that changes is the set operator name

slide 17
Here is a list of few points which we should be kept in mind while working with SQL set operators:

The number of columns in the SELECT statement on which we have applied SQL set operators must be the same.

The selected columns must have the same data type.

The order of the columns must be in the same order as mentioned in the SELECT statement.

slide 18
from this presentation we have learnt about
the types of set operators
their syntax
and their working

thats its from my side, have a great day ahead.
